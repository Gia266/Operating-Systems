Documentation 2/3
-okay documentation, but missing technical details about the implementation in x86 assembly
-instead of including code, describe what each code file does (i.e., selfcomp, client, exploit)

Code Solution 1/3
-deducted mark for not applying exploit to client, and password was not cracked
-exploit code seems to be on the right track, but not correct

Code Clarity 2/2
-code is clear and legible

Testing 0/2
-no testing document provided, no evidence testing was done
